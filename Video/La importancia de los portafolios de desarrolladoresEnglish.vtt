00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.180
I think it refers to the importance it

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.209
has and that is very important because

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.789
in the end it is a competition. If I am going

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.619
to make it clear to you, it is a competition with

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.140
other people and if other people

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.269
today are already more connected  to the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.109
Internet you have the opportunity to learn

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.269
and let's say that the new trends or

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.769
technologies that are found, I

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.749
believe that a portfolio gives much more

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.600
value to what you have already learned, not

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.160
even the companies. In the end, I

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.200
always tell you if you are going to

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.430
hire  someone or like the student and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.870
if you are going to hire someone  I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.940
would hire someone who does not have a

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.820
small portfolio, what would be their

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.580
perspective? Yes, then we also have

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.220
to see it from that point. No, then

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.610
for me the portfolios are very

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.770
important as well as the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.760
professional practices that the students make

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.840
the portfolio. I feel that it is important

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.920
when the student  It does not have an

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.400
experience if, for example, if I leave and I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.380
have not worked and I do not know

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.440
a professional internship in a place

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.090
where I only support computer equipment

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.180
and then I want to work as a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.680
programmer, then that experience is not

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.570
going to be profitable for me, no if  I mean if

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.430
I have this portfolio and I can say look

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.470
now  I made this portfolio I made this

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.810
project it is working I took this

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.220
course because it is going to have much more impact

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.840
than to say today in my

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.200
professional practices I started repairing

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.330
computers yes of course if you are looking for

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.649
work in a place where they are

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.990
repairing computers this is going to be

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.640
valid but  For me it is important, not

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.040
even for the students. I am surprised

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.500
when they come from teachers. I already have two

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.050
letters of recommendation from my two

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.490
previous professional internships. Yes,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.259
because at least in the university where

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.149


00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.670
they do professional internships in

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.680
higher university technicians to put them into

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.020
practice.  their knowledge returns to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.479
engineering, they continue studying and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.429
then finish, they return to do other

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.070
practices  professionals and they already have two

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.500
jobs, let alone two executions

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.970
of projects and also at school

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
they are given to do more projects and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.730
portfolios so that in the end they

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.730
have this experience

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.890
perfect perfect oscar if we also

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.890
want that it is quite important

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.450
it is quite important to have so much

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.950
experience in well yes from real as a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
work portfolio well look here

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.190
